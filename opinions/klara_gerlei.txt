I'm currently trying to decide which grid score to use. I previously used the grid score implemented based on Krupic, Julija et al. “Grid cell symmetry is shaped by environmental geometry.” Nature vol. 518,7538 (2015): 232-235. doi:10.1038/nature14153
My implementation for this is in https://github.com/klaragerlei/grid_score/blob/master/grid_score.py
