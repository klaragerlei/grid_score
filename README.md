# Grid score repository

## Motivation

- I would like to collect and implement as many grid scores as possible to be able to compare them and decide which one to use.
- I'm very interested in why different labs use different grid scores and the reasons for choosing a given implementation so I would like to collect some opinions.

## Ways to contribute

- Add a grid score implementation. Please try not to add duplicates, but anything that is slightly different (or is implemented in a different programming language / much faster) is great. If your code doesn't work on the example data frame I added then please either add an example cell or simulate data if possible.
- Convert an implementation from this repo to an ipython (or some other kind of) notebook where you plot some of the intermediate steps and add some text to explain what is happening.
- Add some sort of visualization that compares two or more implemented grid scores.
- Add you opinion on which grid score to use with references and links to implementations as a text file in the 'opinions' folder.
- Anything else that you think could be useful for someone trying to decide which grid score to use!

Thank you!
